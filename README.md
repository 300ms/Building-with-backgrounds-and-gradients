### Description:

That was "backgrounds and gradients" project, so I used them as much as I could ^^

I, mostly used flex and grid layouts to position items/content. There are many background
images in webpage and there are even :hover effects for them ^^

Completely followed the original pages structure but hierarchy is
more easy and simple.

I have resolution problems because of my monitors(i use square ones, res:1024:768),
so i am having troubles while re-sizing pages and elements but trying to solve that
problem and also using browsers' developer tools and "responsive inspection" feature
to scale resolution at building phase. I hope you like it ^^
